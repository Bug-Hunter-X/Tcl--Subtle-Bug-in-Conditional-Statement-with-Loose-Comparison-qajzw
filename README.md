# Tcl Bug: Loose Comparison in Conditional

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Tcl procedure that arises from using loose comparison instead of strict comparison in a conditional statement.  The `bug.tcl` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.tcl` provides the corrected version.

The bug is related to the handling of string inputs in a numeric conditional. The loose comparison (`==`) doesn't enforce type checking, leading to unexpected results.
